## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

This was fun to put together. This was my first real application that used server-side databases to store data. Learning to understand and put together the code that would eventually allow a user account to be created proved to be pretty difficult at first, especially implementing user-based data logging. I'm really happy with the final result.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8080`
